We're all aware that we've got to fight in the next 15 games.\"\n\nSurely Dortmund are too good to go down?\n\nOne only needs to take a quick glance at the Champions League to notice that on its day, the club can still prove to be a match for Europe's best.\n\nDortmund remains in Europe's premier competition after topping a group also including Arsenal, Galatasaray and Anderlecht, with a 2-0 victory against the Gunners in September showcasing the side at its most fearsome.\n\nWithout the pressures and trappings of the Bundesliga, Dortmund is a different beast altogether.\n\nItalian champion Juventus awaits in the last 16, and you would not bet against Dortmund progressing to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe same cannot be said of its league clash with Freiburg Saturday.\n\nBut CAN Dortmund go down?\n\nPart of the problem is often acknowledging that there is, indeed, a problem. Klopp, in his own mild-mannered way, has refused to hit the panic button and has been under little pressure from the German media, while the club's board has yet to publicly question the coach.\n\nThe Dortmund fans, too, known as some of the most passionate in the world, have continued to voice their support.\n\n\"There are several stadiums with a great atmosphere in the world, but only a few who go wild like [Dortmund's] when you are [struggling],\" Klopp said of the club's fans in December.\n\nThat was until Augsburg.\n\nReports, meanwhile, have suggested that Dortmund will give Klopp -- who to some, given the resources at his disposal, has taken the club as far as he can -- until the end of the month to offer up signs of survival.\n\nRealization has struck that Dortmund's quality alone will not be enough to turn things around and something has to change soon, with the one-month winter break failing to turn around its fortunes.\n\nIf it doesn't, the Dortmund team widely considered too good to go down may end up doing just that.",
